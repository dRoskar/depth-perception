Remake of a web page that allows users to submit multiple images to a canvas that simulates a 3D effect.

## About
This is an old project of mine that I did back when I didn't know much about web programming. I winged it.
I like this project so I decided to remake it.

## What was terrible about the original website?
 - Users had to send an email to submit images
 - Images had to be added by me, manually
 - Data was saved in a text file
 - Almost no backend logic to speak of
 - PHP mixed in with HTML (oh boy)

 ## TO-DO
 - show message if a page doesn't exist
 - detect arrow keys for gallery navigation
 - loading animation
 - allow dynamic canvas sizes - size determined by frontmost image (goodbye frames)
 - make a user submission interface
